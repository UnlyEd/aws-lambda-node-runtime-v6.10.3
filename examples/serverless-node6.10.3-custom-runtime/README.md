# serverless-node6.10.3-custom-runtime example

The example was created running `serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path serverless-node6.10.3-example` using an old version like 1.29.2 which uses node6.10.3

See https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/v1.29.2/lib/plugins/create/templates/aws-nodejs/handler.js

The [serverless.yml](./serverless.yml) explains what was changed compared to the initial template.
Extra comments have been removed for the sake of readability.
